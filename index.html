            About Me
        </h1>
 <p>
     My name is Cornelius Crawley, I am an Upcoming 12th grader, and I enjoy playing video games, and I like to play Chess, and I really enjoy Math. I am a really fun and optimistic individual, but when it comes down to it, I can be momentous. Collaboration is always helpful because more wit never hurt anyone. I like playing video games because it relieves stress and it’s a fun way to get my mind away from reality. I like chess because chess is a way for me to be able to test the skill of the mind against others, and it gives me the ability to gain more intellect. 
I plan to be someone great, I don’t really have a specific goal, but I like coding and I like video games so maybe that can take me somewhere.
